\begin{document}
\maketitle

\indent It will be necessary to type that indent command for the first paragraph, but every other paragraph will be fine (better, even) without it. 

\subsection{Sections}

For sections, you actually have to use ``subsection.'' This is because of the weird way in which apa6e.cls formats section heads. It is dumb and wierd, but whatever. 

\subsubsection{Subsections}

For subsections, use ``subsubsection.'' (Also, don't forget the special way you have to make ``quotes!'')

\paragraph{The next level down}

The next level down is ``paragraph.'' Paragraph headings do not appear in the TOC with current settings, but that can be changed with (textbackslash is the escape for a backslash): 
\begin{quote}
		\texttt{\textbackslash setcounter\{secnumdepth\}\{3\}}
\end{quote}
%\endquote 
I hope you don't need to go any further down than paragraph. 

\subsection{Citations and Beyond}

For a citation, type this \cite{Gill}.  The way to cite a reference you have already used is like so (\citeauthor{Gill}).  If you want to use the author's name in the sentence and cite at the same time, do it this way, like \citeA{Hamlet}.  To ensure that a reference is included in the bibliography even if you didn't use it, use nocite\nocite{Companion, Simpson, Er01, OnlineSource}.  Isn't this fun?

Following this will be the bibliography. 

\bibliographystyle{apacite}
\bibliography{examples}			% Name of .bib doc goes here, minus the .bib ext.

% The following is for any appendices. Comment out or remove if no appendices
%\newpage

%\section{Appendix A: The Content of the Appendix}
%
%If you have appendices, put them here.
