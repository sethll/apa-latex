# APA-LATEX README

This goal of this project is to have a simple method to create APA-formatted 
documents that meet my needs. Sometimes I need a cover page, sometimes I do 
not; sometimes I need an abstract, or a table of contents, but other times not 
so much. 

To use the document, follow the comments.

To build the document, run:

    $ latex template.tex
    $ bibtex template.aux
    $ latex template.tex
    $ latex template.tex

Enjoy!
